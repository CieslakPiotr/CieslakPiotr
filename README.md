## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Web Developer specializing in **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I love building clean, efficient, and scalable applications, exploring new technologies, and solving real-world problems with code.

I'm currently working on my Final Year Project as well as I'm trying to improve my progammming skills. Final Year Project is a web-based booking and management system for hotels. Everything is created with Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. 

I'm looking to collaborate on any projects that will give me some experience in coding and also with companies that need junior software developers. 

To see some of my projects look into my profile.

Ask me about anything you want, I'm happy to answer your questions.
